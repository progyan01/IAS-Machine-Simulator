# IAS Architecture Simulator & Binary Search Implementation

A full software simulation of the **IAS** computer architecture, implementing the stored-program concept. This project includes a custom Assembler, a Processor Simulator, and a demonstration of the `std::lower_bound` algorithm using **self-modifying code**.

## Project Overview

The IAS machine lacks modern features like index registers. To iterate through arrays, programs must dynamically modify their own instructions in memory during runtime.

This project demonstrates that capability by implementing **Binary Search (Lower Bound)** to find the first occurrence of a target number in a sorted array.

### Components
1.  **Assembler (`assembler.py`)**: Converts custom IAS assembly code into 40-bit machine code.
2.  **Simulator (`ias.py`)**: A cycle-accurate simulator that emulates the Fetch-Decode-Execute cycle.
3.  **Algorithm (`assembly.txt`)**: An optimized implementation of `std::lower_bound` ($O(\log N)$) written in IAS Assembly.
